List of websites to practice selenium:
•	Cleartrip: https://www.cleartrip.com/
•	https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/
•	http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ - This is not a full-fledged website, but it offers components of the website that you can test. If you are working on practicing a complex component, I would recommend this site.
•	https://www.saucedemo.com/ - This is a demo website from SauceLabs. It’s a custom eCommerce site by SauceLabs. But, not with much functionality.
•	https://ultimateqa.com/automation - This is also a good site. But, it does not have a complete user journey. If you want to practice just a part of a user journey, this is a good site.
•	http://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/ - This website is not meant to practice test automation. But, you can write a test around this.
•	https://phptravels.org/ - Similarly, this website is not meant to practice. But, for a short time, you can write tests and execute them. Can't be used for demonstration as it may get changed anytime.
•	https://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs/ - This is another open-source site. But, can't expect to have it unchanged.
